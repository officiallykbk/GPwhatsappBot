GhanaPost QR Bot is a WhatsApp-based Flask app that scans GhanaPost QR codes or accepts manual digital addresses (e.g. GA-123-4567) to return full, human-readable location info — including a Google Maps link.

Users can:

📸 Snap & send a GhanaPost QR code

🔠 Or text a digital address directly

📍 Get back structured address + map

💬 All via WhatsApp!
